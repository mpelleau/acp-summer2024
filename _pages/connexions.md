All the course materials will be available on the Caseine plateform, [here](https://moodle.caseine.org/course/view.php?id=1075).

If you already have a Caseine account, you can login to Caseine and enter the course with the following password: ACPWS2024.

Alternatively, if your university is member of the eduGAIN Federation, you can log in by clicking on "Other academic account".

If none of this works, send us an [email](mailto:acp-school2024@grenoble-inp.fr) so we can create you an account.
