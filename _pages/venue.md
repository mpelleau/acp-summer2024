The school will take place at [Centre Paul Langevin](https://www.caes.cnrs.fr/sejours/centre-paul-langevin-3-2/) in Aussois, region Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France.
Aussois is a small Savoyard village facing south at the gateway of the Vanoise National Park at an altitude of 1500 meters.
It is located in the French alps at 200 kilometers of Lyon and 150 kilometers of Grenoble.
Around Lyon, all the necessary infrastructures can be found, including an international airport offering regular and affordable flights to Europe and North America.

To access the school, we plan to organize a bus shuttle from the Lyon « Part-Dieu » Train Station to the school location with a stop at the Lyon International Airport.
For people who cannot use the shuttle, it is also possible to come to the school by taking a direct train from Paris to Modane (8km of Aussois) and to take a public shuttle to join Aussois.
