## Instructions for the registration

The number of places is limited, thus we advise to register early to avoid disappointment.

Registrations are open until the **1st of March**.
If there are still places available at this moment, registrations dates might be extended.

To register, [follow this link](https://dr11.azur-colloque.fr/inscription/en/282/inscription).
Once registered, please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/GAHCTrokJLuZuoLP9) to give additional and mandatory infomations (food restrictions, venue, roomate...).

If you require a visa to visit France, please register early, so that formalities can be handled in time. Also, pay attention to the delay needed to obtain a visa and be sure to have enough time to get it.
